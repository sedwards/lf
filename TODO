* Collect localized versions of the strings and the documentation, and
  include them in future releases.

* Improve the makefile to handle multiple languages more elegantly.

* Rewrite the argument parser, or use someone else's, so that misspelled
  options are usefully flagged instead of being tested as files; so that
  one-letter options can be strung together like -aA; and so that "--" is
  recognized as "end of options".

* Make the LFOPTS parser throw away any file names, with a warning.

* Use a configure system such as GNU autoconf.
